## About

The goal of this project is to provide a concise, reworded reference of the core principles and practices described in *Clean Code*. It is intended for learning and review purposes only. All notes are written in my own words and do not include any copyrighted text from the book.

## Structure

Each section corresponds to a chapter or key concept in the book. Rather than copying the original text, each note is:

- **Paraphrased** using original wording.
- **Summarized** for clarity and brevity.
- **Accompanied by examples** where applicable.

> Example: Instead of saying "Itâ€™s better to throw an exception...", we might write:
> "Throwing exceptions can lead to cleaner code by removing repetitive error checking logic from the caller."
