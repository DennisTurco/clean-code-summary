# Understanding Clean Code
## Recognizing bad code
Before learning what makes code clean, we must first see why bad code is harmful. In many workplaces, pressure to meet deadlines leads to rushed development. This results in messy, tangled codebases where features pile up on shaky foundations. Over time, such code becomes difficult to manage, slowing down progress and risking the entire project's health even the company's survival.

As programmers, we've all struggled with frustrating code that wastes time and energy a phenomenon sometimes called wading through code. Despite this, it's common to delay fixing issues, telling ourselves we'll clean up later. However, as LeBlanc's Law warns: Later means never.

As messiness grows, team productivity plummets. Companies try to fix this by hiring more developers, but newcomers often lack knowledge of the system's design and unintentionally add to the confusion. The cycle of mounting technical debt and chaos continues, making it harder to deliver quality software.

### The false hope of complete rewrites
Complete rewrites are long, risky, and often fail, creating new messy code. The key is to maintain clean code continuously.

### Attidute is key
Bad code is a sign of unprofessionalism. Developers must insist on quality, just like doctors reject unsafe practices.

### The core dilemma
Trying to save time by writing sloppy code backfires bad code slows everything down. The real shortcut is to write clean code from the very start.

### Mastering clean code
Writing clean code is a skill and an art, requiring discipline and a developed “code sense” to transform messy code into elegant solutions.

### What is clean code?
[Refactoring Guru - Clean Code](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/what-is-refactoring)
There's no single definition, but respected developers share some principles:
* **Bjarne Stroustrup**: Clean code is efficient, straightforward, easy to maintain, and performs well. It "does one thing well."
* **Grady Booch**: It reads like prose and reflects clear intent through well structured abstractions.
* **Dave Thomas**: It's readable and maintainable by others, has meaningful names, minimal dependencies, and good tests.
* **Michael Feathers**: Clean code looks like it was written by someone who cares. Every detail was considered and refined.
* **Ron Jeffries**: It minimizes duplication, is expressive, and uses simple, abstract solutions to avoid complexity.
* **Ward Cunningham**: Clean code is intuitive. You read a method and it's exactly what you expected elegant and natural.

### Writing for others
Code is read far more than written; clean code helps teammates and your future self maintain and improve it.

### The boy scout rule
[DEVIQ - The boy scout rule](https://deviq.com/principles/boy-scout-rule)
Always leave code cleaner than you found it. Small, ongoing improvements keep the codebase healthy and sustainable.
